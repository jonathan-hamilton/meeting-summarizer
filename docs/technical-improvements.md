## 2025-01-22: Speaker Color System Centralization

### Overview
Centralized speaker color management system to eliminate code duplication and ensure consistent speaker visualization across all UI components.

### Improvements Implemented

#### 1. Centralized Color Utility Creation
**Problem:** Multiple components had duplicate `getSpeakerColor` functions with inconsistent color arrays, leading to different speaker colors across UI elements.

**Solution:** 
- Created centralized `theme/speakerColors.ts` utility module
- Implemented consistent 10-color palette with hash-based speaker assignment
- Exported through main theme module for easy import access

**Technical Details:**
```typescript
// Centralized color palette (10 distinct colors)
const SPEAKER_COLORS = [
  "#1976d2", "#dc004e", "#00796b", "#f57c00",
  "#7b1fa2", "#388e3c", "#d32f2f", "#1565c0",
  "#5d4037", "#303f9f"
];

// Hash-based consistent assignment algorithm
export const getSpeakerColor = (speakerName: string): string => {
  const hash = speakerName.split('').reduce((acc, char) => 
    char.charCodeAt(0) + ((acc << 5) - acc), 0);
  return SPEAKER_COLORS[Math.abs(hash) % SPEAKER_COLORS.length];
};
```

#### 2. Component Deduplication & Integration
**Problem:** Three components (`SpeakerMapping.tsx`, `SpeakerMappingDialog.tsx`, `TranscriptSpeakerSegment.tsx`) each had their own `getSpeakerColor` implementation.

**Solution:**
- Removed duplicate functions from all three components
- Updated imports to use centralized utility
- Standardized styling approach across all speaker chips
- Updated test files to use centralized function

**Components Updated:**
- `SpeakerMapping.tsx`: Removed local color function, updated all Chip components with consistent `sx` styling
- `SpeakerMappingDialog.tsx`: Removed duplicate function, using centralized import
- `TranscriptSpeakerSegment.tsx`: Cleaned up color logic and menu functionality

#### 3. Consistent UI Styling Implementation
**Problem:** Speaker chips had inconsistent styling patterns across different components.

**Solution:**
- Standardized all speaker chips to use `sx` prop for styling
- Ensured consistent text color (`white`) and background color application
- Maintained visual consistency across speaker mapping and transcript views

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** - All speaker components now use centralized color system with consistent 10-color palette

## 2025-01-22: Layout Centering & Development Tools Enhancement

### Overview
Comprehensive UI/UX improvements focused on responsive layout centering and enhanced development workflow tools.

### Improvements Implemented

#### 1. Responsive Layout Centering System
**Problem:** Application layout was not properly centered in wide viewports, causing poor user experience on ultrawide monitors.

**Solution:** 
- Implemented viewport-based positioning with `position: fixed` and full viewport dimensions
- Added responsive margin system using Material-UI breakpoints
- Created nested flexbox container architecture for reliable centering

**Technical Details:**
```tsx
// Outer container: Full viewport with flexbox centering
sx={{
  width: "100vw !important",
  minHeight: "100vh",
  display: "flex !important",
  flexDirection: "column !important",
  alignItems: "center !important",
  justifyContent: "center !important",
  position: "fixed",
  top: 0,
  left: 0,
}}

// Inner container: Responsive margins by screen size
sx={{
  maxWidth: "1200px",
  px: { xs: 2, sm: 3, md: 4, lg: 6, xl: 8 },
}}
```

**Responsive Margin Strategy:**
- **xs (0-600px)**: 16px margins (mobile)
- **sm (600-900px)**: 24px margins (tablets)
- **md (900-1200px)**: 32px margins (small laptops)
- **lg (1200-1536px)**: 48px margins (desktops)
- **xl (1536px+)**: 64px margins (ultrawide displays)

#### 2. OpenAI Development Toggle System
**Problem:** Developers needed ability to switch between real OpenAI API calls and mock services during development.

**Solution:**
- Created `OpenAIController.cs` with toggle endpoints
- Enhanced service configuration to respect toggle state
- Added frontend toggle switch in development mode only
- Implemented real-time status indicators

**Backend Implementation:**
```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class OpenAIController : ControllerBase
{
    private static bool _isOpenAIEnabled = true;
    
    [HttpGet("status")]
    public IActionResult GetStatus() => Ok(new { isEnabled = _isOpenAIEnabled });
    
    [HttpPost("toggle")]
    public IActionResult Toggle([FromBody] ToggleRequest request)
    {
        _isOpenAIEnabled = request.IsEnabled;
        return Ok(new { isEnabled = _isOpenAIEnabled });
    }
}
```

**Frontend Integration:**
- Toggle switch in AppBar (development mode only)
- Real-time status checking every 30 seconds
- Visual indicators for service state
- Tooltips explaining current mode

#### 3. Enhanced Speaker Assignment System
**Problem:** Speaker assignment workflow had consistency issues and session management needed improvement.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced session-based override functionality
- Improved speaker name resolution logic
- Better integration between dialog and segment components
- Fixed debug logging and error handling

**Key Improvements:**
- Session overrides now properly persist during user session
- Enhanced speaker name resolution checks session overrides first
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Better integration with existing speaker mapping system

#### 4. UI Consistency Fixes
**Problem:** Component widths were inconsistent across different workflow states.

**Solution:**
- Fixed FileUpload component width constraints
- Ensured consistent component sizing throughout workflow
- Improved responsive behavior across all screen sizes
- Enhanced visual consistency with Material-UI design system

### Files Modified

2. **Accessibility**: Enhance ARIA labels and keyboard navigation for development tools
3. **Performance**: Monitor layout performance on lower-end devices
4. **Testing**: Add automated tests for responsive layout behavior
