The SpeakerMappingComponent only considers auto-detected speakers when calculating unmapped/mapped speakers, ignoring manually-added speakers in the main display.

**Required Fix:**

- Update SpeakerMappingComponent logic to include both auto-detected AND manually-added speakers in the mapping display
- Manually-added speakers should appear in "Mapped Speakers" section when they have name/role assigned
- Manually-added speakers should appear in "Unmapped Speakers" section when they lack name/role assignment
- Enhance unmapped speaker calculation to consider all speakers (detected + manually-added) rather than just detectedSpeakers array

---

## Story S2.6: Speaker Mapping Display Integration Fix

### S2.6 Developer Notes

**Root Cause:** Current `SpeakerMappingComponent` at line 53 only considers `detectedSpeakers` array when calculating unmapped speakers, missing manually-added speakers from the mappings.

**Required Changes:**

1. **Enhanced Speaker List Calculation:**

```tsx
// Current (incorrect):
const unmappedSpeakers = detectedSpeakers.filter(
  (speaker) => !mappings.some((m) => m.speakerId === speaker)
);

// Required (correct):
const allSpeakers = [...detectedSpeakers, ...mappings.map(m => m.speakerId)];
const uniqueSpeakers = Array.from(new Set(allSpeakers));
const unmappedSpeakers = uniqueSpeakers.filter(speakerId => {
  const mapping = mappings.find(m => m.speakerId === speakerId);
  return !mapping || !mapping.name; // Unmapped if no mapping or no name
});
```

1. **Source-Aware Display Logic:**

- Add speaker source indicators in main display
- Show auto-detected vs manually-added visual cues
- Maintain consistent iconography with dialog

1. **State Synchronization:**

- Ensure `handleMappingsSaved` properly updates component state
- Verify real-time display updates when dialog saves changes

**Time Estimate:** 1-2 hours (focused bug fix)

## Technical Rationale

Sprint 2 transforms the application from a basic transcription tool into an intelligent meeting assistant with comprehensive speaker management capabilities. By adding speaker role mapping, enhanced speaker management, manual override functionality, and AI summarization, we create immediate value for business users while establishing the architecture for advanced personalization features in future sprints.

The expanded dependency chain (S2.1 → S2.2 → S2.5 → S2.6 → S2.7 → S2.8 → S2.3 → S2.4) ensures each story builds logically on the previous one, with clear integration points and testable deliverables at each stage. The speaker override functionality (S2.7-S2.8) addresses real-world scenarios where automatic detection fails, providing users with complete control over speaker identification while maintaining audit trails for data integrity.

**Key Technical Achievements:**

- Complete speaker lifecycle management (detect → map → override → audit)
- Robust error correction workflows with revert capabilities  
- Comprehensive audit trails for enterprise compliance requirements
- Foundation for advanced AI features with reliable speaker data
