## Technical Rationale

These stories establish the core transcription pipeline that delivers immediate value to users. The dependency chain is minimal (S1.1 â†’ S1.2 â†’ S1.3 â†’ S1.4) and creates a working end-to-end feature with production-ready OpenAI integration. This foundation enables speaker mapping and summarization features in future sprints while providing a robust, scalable backend service.
