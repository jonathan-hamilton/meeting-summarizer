- API key validation and error handling for invalid/missing credentials
- Cost monitoring and usage tracking considerations documented
- Performance comparison between mock and real OpenAI services

### S1.4 Dependencies

S1.1 - Audio Transcription Backend Service, S1.3 - File Upload Integration

### S1.4 Developer Notes

- Update `appsettings.Production.json` with OpenAI configuration template
- Document environment variable setup (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc.)
- Test automatic fallback when OpenAI API is unavailable
- Implement proper error handling for API quota/rate limiting
- Document cost implications and usage monitoring
- Create deployment checklist for production environments

### S1.4 Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Configuration Setup

- Secure API key management (environment variables, Azure Key Vault, etc.)
- Production configuration templates
- Documentation for deployment teams

#### Phase 2: Testing & Validation

- End-to-end testing with real OpenAI API
- Performance benchmarking vs mock service
- Error scenario testing (invalid keys, rate limits, network issues)

#### Phase 3: Production Readiness

- ✅ Comprehensive request validation and timeout handling
- ✅ Production configuration template (appsettings.Production.json)
- ✅ Environment variable support for secure API key management
- ✅ Detailed logging and monitoring capabilities
- ✅ Automatic fallback service integration
- ✅ Complete setup documentation and scripts

**Key Features Added:**

## Sprint 1 Integration Workflow

### Complete User Journey

1. **Upload Audio** (S1.3): User drags and drops audio file into intuitive upload interface
2. **Automatic Transcription** (S1.1): System processes audio with OpenAI Whisper API and speaker diarization
3. **Display Results** (S1.2): User views color-coded transcript with speaker segments and metadata
4. **Production Ready** (S1.4): Secure, scalable deployment with comprehensive error handling

### Technical Architecture

```text
FileUpload → AudioValidation → Transcription → SpeakerDiarization → Display
    ↓           ↓                ↓              ↓                  ↓
  S1.3        S1.1             S1.1           S1.1               S1.2
                                ↓
                        OpenAI/Mock Service (S1.4)
```

## Sprint 1 Success Metrics

- **Functional**: Complete end-to-end transcription workflow from upload to display
- **Quality**: Accurate transcription with speaker diarization and visual organization
- **Reliability**: Production-ready error handling with automatic fallback service
- **Performance**: Reasonable response times for transcription processing
- **Usability**: Intuitive drag-and-drop interface with clear progress indicators
- **Security**: Secure API key management and comprehensive input validation

## Future Sprint Foundation

Sprint 1 establishes the technical foundation for:

- **Sprint 2**: Speaker role mapping and AI-powered meeting summarization
- **Sprint 3**: Email automation and stakeholder distribution
- **Sprint 4**: Meeting history and transcript management
- **Sprint 5**: Advanced role inference and automatic speaker identification

## Technical Rationale

These stories establish the core transcription pipeline that delivers immediate value to users. The dependency chain is minimal (S1.1 → S1.2 → S1.3 → S1.4) and creates a working end-to-end feature with production-ready OpenAI integration. This foundation enables speaker mapping and summarization features in future sprints while providing a robust, scalable backend service.
