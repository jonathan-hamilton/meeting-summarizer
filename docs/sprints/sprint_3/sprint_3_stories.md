### Story S3.1: Session-Based Speaker Override & Privacy Controls

As a privacy-conscious user, I want my speaker override actions to be preserved during my current session with clear controls over my data, so that I can correct speaker assignments without compromising my privacy or having my meeting data stored permanently.

#### S3.1 Acceptance Criteria

**Session-Based Persistence Requirements:**

- Manual speaker overrides are preserved only during the current browser session
- Original auto-detected values are maintained as fallback when overrides are cleared
- Override metadata includes session timestamp for revert functionality
- All override data is automatically cleared when the browser session ends
- No persistent storage of user meeting data beyond the active session

**Privacy Protection Requirements:**

- Clear visual indicators showing data is session-only and will not be permanently stored
- User notification system explaining session-based data handling with clear messaging that closing the browser window will automatically clear all session data
- Session timeout warnings with data preservation options
- Privacy policy integration explaining session-based approach

**Revert Functionality:**

- [Revert to Original] option available for each overridden speaker during session
- Bulk revert option to restore all speakers to auto-detected values
- Revert confirmation dialog prevents accidental data loss
- Session-scoped override tracking for undo/redo functionality
- Clear visual feedback when revert operations complete successfully

#### S3.1 Dependencies

S2.7 - Manual Speaker Override Interface (prerequisite for override functionality)

#### S3.1 Developer Notes

**Backend Implementation:**

- Extend current InMemorySpeakerMappingService with session-based override tracking
- Implement session-scoped override metadata (OriginalName, OriginalRole, IsOverridden, SessionTimestamp)
- Create session-based revert functionality without persistent audit trail
- Add automatic session cleanup and data deletion mechanisms

**Data Models:**

```csharp
public class SessionSpeakerMappingWithOverride : SpeakerMapping
{
    public string? OriginalName { get; set; }
    public string? OriginalRole { get; set; }
    public bool IsOverridden { get; set; }
    public DateTime? SessionTimestamp { get; set; }
    public string SessionId { get; set; }
}

{
    public string SessionId { get; set; }
    public Dictionary<string, SessionOverrideAction> Actions { get; set; }
    public DateTime SessionStarted { get; set; }
    public DateTime LastActivity { get; set; }
}

public class SessionOverrideAction
{
    public string Action { get; set; } // Override, Revert, Clear
    public string? OriginalValue { get; set; }
    public string? NewValue { get; set; }
    public DateTime Timestamp { get; set; }
}
```

**Frontend Integration:**

- Implement session-based API service with clear session management
- Add privacy indicators and session status display in SpeakerMappingDialog

                               S3.6 Testing Suite (Cross-cutting)
```

**Key Integration Points:**

- S3.0 provides foundation test coverage for Sprint 3 infrastructure before implementing new features
- S3.1 builds directly on S2.7's override infrastructure with session-based persistence for privacy protection
- S3.2 provides comprehensive CRUD operations for speaker management through dedicated dialog interface
- S3.3 completes the override workflow with segment-level granularity building on S3.2's speaker management
- S3.4 provides immediate export capabilities without requiring persistent data storage
- S3.5 ensures users understand and control their session-based data handling
- S3.6 provides comprehensive testing coverage across all implemented features with privacy validation

**Technical Dependencies:**

- All stories build upon the completed Sprint 2 foundation (S2.1-S2.7)
- S3.0 validates Sprint 3 foundation work (Zustand stores, session management, performance optimizations)
- S3.1 requires S2.7's override interface implementation and S3.0's validated foundation for session-based persistence
- S3.2 builds on S2.7 and S3.0's tested foundation to provide comprehensive CRUD operations for speaker management
- S3.3 depends on S3.2's CRUD interface for complete speaker management before segment-level overrides
- S3.4 integrates with S2.4 export functionality and session-based speaker workflow
- S3.5 depends on S3.1's session management for privacy controls
- S3.6 validates all implemented features with focus on data privacy and session management

## Success Metrics

- **Privacy Protection**: Session-based data handling with automatic cleanup and user controls
- **Data Minimization**: Override actions preserved only during session with no permanent storage
- **Granular Control**: Users can correct individual transcript segments with immediate visual feedback
- **Export Efficiency**: Multiple export formats generate correctly for immediate download and sharing
- **Performance**: Application handles large files and concurrent users without data retention overhead
- **Security**: Session-based approach eliminates long-term data exposure risks
- **User Adoption**: Reduced privacy concerns increase user confidence and application usage
- **Transparency**: Clear communication builds trust through privacy-first approach

## Foundation for Next Sprint

Sprint 3 establishes the foundation for:

- **Sprint 4**: Advanced AI features (auto-speaker detection, meeting insights) with privacy-first approach
- **Sprint 5**: Enterprise features (team collaboration, administrative controls) with optional data retention policies
- **Sprint 6**: Privacy-conscious integrations (calendar sync, automated summaries) with user-controlled data handling
- **Sprint 7**: Analytics and insights with aggregated, non-personal data analysis

## Technical Rationale

Sprint 3 completes the comprehensive speaker management system while implementing a privacy-first architecture that minimizes data retention and maximizes user control. By implementing session-based persistence (S3.1) and segment-level control (S3.2), we provide users with complete control over speaker accuracy while ensuring their meeting data is not permanently stored.

The enhanced export capabilities (S3.3) enable immediate value extraction from meeting sessions without requiring long-term data storage. The privacy communication and control system (S3.4) builds user trust through transparency and clear data handling policies.

The comprehensive testing suite (S3.5) addresses the existing testing recommendations while ensuring production readiness across performance, security, and privacy protection scenarios. This establishes confidence for privacy-conscious users and provides regression protection for future development.

The progression from granular speaker control to enhanced export capabilities creates a natural evolution toward advanced AI features while maintaining the core value proposition of accurate, actionable meeting insights with complete user privacy protection and data minimization.
