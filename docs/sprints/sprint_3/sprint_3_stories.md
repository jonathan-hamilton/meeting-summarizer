### Story S3.2: Speaker CRUD Operations Interface

As a user, I want to manage speaker mappings through a comprehensive interface so that I can create, update, and delete speaker assignments with full control over my transcript accuracy.

#### S3.2 Acceptance Criteria

**CRUD Interface Requirements:**

- "Edit/Delete Mappings" button prominently displayed in the top right of TranscriptDisplay component

- Real-time validation prevents conflicts with existing speaker names
- Original auto-detected values preserved as fallback when speakers are manually updated
- Updated speaker names reflected immediately in transcript segment displays
- Session-scoped update history maintained for revert capabilities

**Delete Operations:**

- Speaker counts and statistics updated immediately after deletion
- Cascading updates to all dependent components and displays

**Session Integration:**

- All CRUD operations integrate with session-based data handling (no persistent storage)

                               S3.6 Testing Suite (Cross-cutting)
```

**Key Integration Points:**

- S3.0 provides foundation test coverage for Sprint 3 infrastructure before implementing new features
- S3.1 builds directly on S2.7's override infrastructure with session-based persistence for privacy protection

- S3.4 provides immediate export capabilities without requiring persistent data storage
- S3.5 ensures users understand and control their session-based data handling
- S3.6 provides comprehensive testing coverage across all implemented features with privacy validation

**Technical Dependencies:**

- All stories build upon the completed Sprint 2 foundation (S2.1-S2.7)
- S3.0 validates Sprint 3 foundation work (Zustand stores, session management, performance optimizations)
- S3.1 requires S2.7's override interface implementation and S3.0's validated foundation for session-based persistence
- S3.2 builds on S2.7 and S3.0's tested foundation to provide comprehensive CRUD operations for speaker management
- S3.3 depends on S3.2's CRUD interface for complete speaker management before segment-level overrides
- S3.4 integrates with S2.4 export functionality and session-based speaker workflow
- S3.5 depends on S3.1's session management for privacy controls
- S3.6 validates all implemented features with focus on data privacy and session management

## Success Metrics

- **Privacy Protection**: Session-based data handling with automatic cleanup and user controls
- **Data Minimization**: Override actions preserved only during session with no permanent storage
- **Granular Control**: Users can correct individual transcript segments with immediate visual feedback
- **Export Efficiency**: Multiple export formats generate correctly for immediate download and sharing
- **Performance**: Application handles large files and concurrent users without data retention overhead
- **Security**: Session-based approach eliminates long-term data exposure risks
- **User Adoption**: Reduced privacy concerns increase user confidence and application usage
- **Transparency**: Clear communication builds trust through privacy-first approach

## Foundation for Next Sprint

Sprint 3 establishes the foundation for:

- **Sprint 4**: Advanced AI features (auto-speaker detection, meeting insights) with privacy-first approach
- **Sprint 5**: Enterprise features (team collaboration, administrative controls) with optional data retention policies
- **Sprint 6**: Privacy-conscious integrations (calendar sync, automated summaries) with user-controlled data handling
- **Sprint 7**: Analytics and insights with aggregated, non-personal data analysis

## Technical Rationale

Sprint 3 completes the comprehensive speaker management system while implementing a privacy-first architecture that minimizes data retention and maximizes user control. By implementing session-based persistence (S3.1) and segment-level control (S3.2), we provide users with complete control over speaker accuracy while ensuring their meeting data is not permanently stored.

The enhanced export capabilities (S3.3) enable immediate value extraction from meeting sessions without requiring long-term data storage. The privacy communication and control system (S3.4) builds user trust through transparency and clear data handling policies.

The comprehensive testing suite (S3.5) addresses the existing testing recommendations while ensuring production readiness across performance, security, and privacy protection scenarios. This establishes confidence for privacy-conscious users and provides regression protection for future development.

The progression from granular speaker control to enhanced export capabilities creates a natural evolution toward advanced AI features while maintaining the core value proposition of accurate, actionable meeting insights with complete user privacy protection and data minimization.
