# Story S3.6: Performance and Security Testing Suite

**Status:** PENDING ðŸ”„  
**Dependencies:** None

## Overview

As a development team, we need comprehensive testing coverage for performance, security, and error handling scenarios to ensure production readiness and identify potential issues before deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Performance Testing:**

- Large file upload testing with files exceeding 100MB to validate system limits
- Concurrent user simulation testing for multiple simultaneous transcriptions
- Memory usage profiling during long-running transcription processes
- API response time benchmarking under various load conditions
- Frontend performance testing with large transcript displays

**Security Testing:**

- Rate limiting validation to prevent API abuse and ensure fair usage
- Input validation testing for all user-facing forms and file uploads
- Authentication and authorization testing for protected endpoints
- SQL injection and XSS vulnerability testing (even with in-memory storage)
- File upload security testing including malicious file detection

**Error Handling Testing:**

- Frontend error boundary testing with simulated component failures
- Network failure simulation and recovery testing
- OpenAI API failure simulation and graceful degradation validation
- File corruption handling and user feedback testing
- Session timeout and authentication failure recovery

**Integration Testing:**

- Limited live OpenAI API testing with dedicated test account
- End-to-end workflow testing from upload to summary export
- Cross-browser compatibility testing for major browsers
- Mobile responsiveness testing for key user workflows
- Accessibility testing for screen readers and keyboard navigation

## Developer Notes

**Testing Infrastructure:**

- Set up performance testing using tools like Lighthouse and WebPageTest
- Implement load testing using tools like Artillery or k6
- Create security testing suite using OWASP ZAP or similar tools
- Establish continuous performance monitoring and regression detection

**Test Data Management:**

- Create standardized test audio files of various sizes and quality levels
- Develop mock data generators for large-scale testing scenarios
- Implement test environment isolation for security testing
- Create automated test data cleanup and reset procedures

**Monitoring and Reporting:**

- Implement performance metrics collection and reporting
- Create automated security scan reports
- Set up error tracking and alerting for production issues
- Establish performance benchmarks and regression detection

**Testing Priorities from Previous Planning:**

- âœ… Performance testing suite - Large file upload testing (>100MB files)
- âœ… Real API integration tests - Limited live OpenAI API testing with test account
- âœ… Error boundary testing - Frontend error handling and recovery
- âœ… Security testing - Rate limiting and input validation

All previously identified testing requirements have been incorporated into this comprehensive testing suite story.

**Time Estimate:** 6-8 hours (testing framework and initial test suite)
