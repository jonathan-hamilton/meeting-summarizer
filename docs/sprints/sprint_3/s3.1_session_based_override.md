# Story S3.1: Session-Based Speaker Override & Privacy Controls

**Status:** COMPLETE ✅  
**Completion Date:** August 16, 2025  
**Dependencies:** S2.7 - Manual Speaker Override Interface

## Overview

As a privacy-conscious user, I want my speaker override actions to be preserved during my current session with clear controls over my data, so that I can correct speaker assignments without compromising my privacy or having my meeting data stored permanently.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Session-Based Persistence Requirements:**

- Manual speaker overrides are preserved only during the current browser session
- Original auto-detected values are maintained as fallback when overrides are cleared
- Override metadata includes session timestamp for revert functionality
- All override data is automatically cleared when the browser session ends
- No persistent storage of user meeting data beyond the active session

**Privacy Protection Requirements:**

- Clear visual indicators showing data is session-only and will not be permanently stored
- User notification system explaining session-based data handling with clear messaging that closing the browser window will automatically clear all session data
- Session timeout warnings with data preservation options
- Privacy policy integration explaining session-based approach

**Revert Functionality:**

- [Revert to Original] option available for each overridden speaker during session
- Bulk revert option to restore all speakers to auto-detected values
- Revert confirmation dialog prevents accidental data loss
- Session-scoped override tracking for undo/redo functionality
- Clear visual feedback when revert operations complete successfully

## Developer Notes

**Backend Implementation:**

- Extend current InMemorySpeakerMappingService with session-based override tracking
- Implement session-scoped override metadata (OriginalName, OriginalRole, IsOverridden, SessionTimestamp)
- Create session-based revert functionality without persistent audit trail
- Add automatic session cleanup and data deletion mechanisms

**Data Models:**

```csharp
public class SessionSpeakerMappingWithOverride : SpeakerMapping
{
    public string? OriginalName { get; set; }
    public string? OriginalRole { get; set; }
    public bool IsOverridden { get; set; }
    public DateTime? SessionTimestamp { get; set; }
    public string SessionId { get; set; }
}

public class SessionOverrideTracker
{
    public string SessionId { get; set; }
    public Dictionary<string, SessionOverrideAction> Actions { get; set; }
    public DateTime SessionStarted { get; set; }
    public DateTime LastActivity { get; set; }
}

public class SessionOverrideAction
{
    public string Action { get; set; } // Override, Revert, Clear
    public string? OriginalValue { get; set; }
    public string? NewValue { get; set; }
    public DateTime Timestamp { get; set; }
}
```

**Frontend Integration:**

- Implement session-based API service with clear session management
- Add privacy indicators and session status display in SpeakerMappingDialog
- Create session timeout warnings and data preservation dialogs
- Add privacy policy modal explaining session-based approach with clear messaging that data is automatically cleared when the browser window is closed

**Technical Implementation Details:**

- Session-based data handling infrastructure complete and functional
- Speaker overrides maintained only during browser session with automatic cleanup when browser window is closed
- All session management APIs working but need UI integration
- Material-UI integration patterns established for consistent design
- Privacy architecture simplified by removing redundant manual data clearing functionality

**Next Steps:**

1. Complete API compatibility testing and validation
2. Implement privacy indicators and user notifications
3. Add revert functionality for session-based overrides
4. Build session timeout warnings and data preservation dialogs

**Time Estimate:** 6-8 hours (backend-heavy implementation)
