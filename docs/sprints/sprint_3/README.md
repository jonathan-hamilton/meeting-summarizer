# Sprint 3: Speaker Override Persistence & Advanced Features

## Sprint Overview

Sprint 3 completes the comprehensive speaker management system initiated in Sprint 2 with privacy-first session-based persistence. This sprint focuses on session-scoped speaker override functionality, segment-level speaker control, and enhanced export capabilities while maintaining strict data minimization principles. The application remains intentionally session-based to protect user privacy and minimize data retention.

## Sprint 3 Goals

- Validate Sprint 3 foundation work through comprehensive test coverage for Zustand stores and session management
- Complete speaker override workflow with session-based revert capabilities and user privacy protection
- Enable segment-level speaker reassignment for granular transcript accuracy during active sessions
- Implement enhanced export capabilities with immediate download and sharing options
- Build robust testing framework addressing performance, security, and error handling
- Establish clear user communication about session-based data handling and privacy protection
- Create foundation for privacy-conscious enterprise features

**Key Integration Points:**

- S3.0 provides foundation test coverage for Sprint 3 infrastructure before implementing new features
- S3.1 builds directly on S2.7's override infrastructure with session-based persistence for privacy protection
- S3.2 provides comprehensive CRUD operations for speaker management through dedicated dialog interface
- S3.3 completes the override workflow with segment-level granularity building on S3.2's speaker management
- S3.4 provides immediate export capabilities without requiring persistent data storage
- S3.5 ensures users understand and control their session-based data handling
- S3.6 provides comprehensive testing coverage across all implemented features with privacy validation

## Success Metrics

- **Privacy Protection**: Session-based data handling with automatic cleanup and user controls
- **Data Minimization**: Override actions preserved only during session with no permanent storage
- **Granular Control**: Users can correct individual transcript segments with immediate visual feedback
- **Export Efficiency**: Multiple export formats generate correctly for immediate download and sharing
- **Performance**: Application handles large files and concurrent users without data retention overhead
- **Security**: Session-based approach eliminates long-term data exposure risks
- **User Adoption**: Reduced privacy concerns increase user confidence and application usage
- **Transparency**: Clear communication builds trust through privacy-first approach

## Foundation for Next Sprint

Sprint 3 establishes the foundation for:

- **Sprint 4**: Advanced AI features (auto-speaker detection, meeting insights) with privacy-first approach
- **Sprint 5**: Enterprise features (team collaboration, administrative controls) with optional data retention policies
- **Sprint 6**: Privacy-conscious integrations (calendar sync, automated summaries) with user-controlled data handling
- **Sprint 7**: Analytics and insights with aggregated, non-personal data analysis

## Technical Rationale

Sprint 3 completes the comprehensive speaker management system while implementing a privacy-first architecture that minimizes data retention and maximizes user control. By implementing session-based persistence (S3.1) and segment-level control (S3.2), we provide users with complete control over speaker accuracy while ensuring their meeting data is not permanently stored.

The enhanced export capabilities (S3.3) enable immediate value extraction from meeting sessions without requiring long-term data storage. The privacy communication and control system (S3.4) builds user trust through transparency and clear data handling policies.

The comprehensive testing suite (S3.5) addresses the existing testing recommendations while ensuring production readiness across performance, security, and privacy protection scenarios. This establishes confidence for privacy-conscious users and provides regression protection for future development.

The progression from granular speaker control to enhanced export capabilities creates a natural evolution toward advanced AI features while maintaining the core value proposition of accurate, actionable meeting insights with complete user privacy protection and data minimization.
