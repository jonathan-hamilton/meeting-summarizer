# Project Scaffolding Stories for MeetingSummarizer API

## âœ… Scaffolding Phase Complete

**Status**: All scaffolding stories (SC-001 through SC-004) have been completed successfully.

**Summary**: The foundational infrastructure for the Meeting Summarizer application has been established, including:

- .NET 9 Web API backend with Swagger documentation
- React + TypeScript + Material-UI frontend
- OpenAI integration with proper configuration management  
- Complete file upload infrastructure (backend and frontend)

**Next Phase**: Sprint 1 feature development (S1.1-S1.3) for core transcription capabilities.
