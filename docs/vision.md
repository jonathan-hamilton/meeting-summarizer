# Meeting Summarizer - Vision Statement

We are building **MeetingSummarizer**, a modern web application that automates the transcription and summarization of meeting audio. The goal is to help users extract **clear summaries and actionable takeaways**, without replaying or reviewing full meeting recordings.

This project serves as a learning and prototyping tool for exploring how AI can be applied in software development workflows and product design. The goal is to create something useful, extensible, and potentially monetizable ‚Äî while keeping MVP costs to a minimum.

## üß† Mission

To reduce meeting fatigue and information overload by using AI to deliver both full transcripts and **concise, role-relevant summaries** ‚Äî with the potential to deliver personalized action items by email.
